# Vulnerability-CLT
Interview case for SafeBoard internship

## Description
The case was about creating a console utility for scanning all files in directory (and in all sub-directories).
Utility reads all parsable text files in directories, looks up predefined strings and counts vulnerabilities.
After running, it forms a text report and prints it to console.

## Installation
To play with project, simply download it. If you want to run it for test purposes, you can use
```
dotnet run -d
```
or, if you want to install it and try as a tool, you need to install it as package from ./nupkg folder and then use it
```
dotnet tool install --global --add-source ./nupkg
vsan -d
```
